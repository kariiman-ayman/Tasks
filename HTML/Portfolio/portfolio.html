        <p>
          I build modern, clean, and user-focused web applications using
          JavaScript, React, and strong software-engineering foundations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m an Information Systems graduate from the Faculty of Computers and
          Artificial Intelligence, Cairo University (Class of 2024).
        </p>

        <p>
          I specialize in front-end development and enjoy creating functional,
          responsive, and visually engaging user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my studies, I built several front-end projects — from recipe
          apps and workout trackers to an intelligent academic platform that
          helps tech students plan their learning paths. My graduation project
          received an A+. I love building things that solve real problems,
          learning new technologies, and continuously improving my development
          skills.

          I live in Cairo, Egypt. I speak Arabic and English. My pronouns are
